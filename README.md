I’m excited to share my latest web project — Spicy Store, an e-commerce concept built with:
✅ React.js (Component-based architecture)
 ✅ Vite (super-fast bundler & dev server)
 ✅ Tailwind CSS + daisyUI (for sleek, responsive design)
 ✅ React Router DOM (for smooth page navigation)
 ✅ GitHub Pages (for seamless deployment)
🔗 Live Demo: https://lnkd.in/gbnSDqEm
👨‍💻 Key Features:
🛒 Customers can add or remove items from the cart
🔍 Search functionality to quickly find favorite spices
🧾 View detailed product pages dynamically
🧭 Clean multi-page navigation with React Router
🎨 Beautiful and responsive design using Tailwind + daisyUI

💡 This project helped me level up in:
Deploying SPAs with routing on GitHub Pages
Managing dynamic routes and local state
Building clean, scalable UIs using component-based architecture
Thanks to everyone who helped test and give feedback 🙌
I’d love your thoughts! Feel free to check it out.
